# COT4500 Assignment 2
 
## requirements.txt
requirements.txt contains all python libraries required. For this project, it is just numpy.
In order to install these dependencies, run the following in the command line, assuming you have pip (and it is up to date):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
In order to run the program, make sure you have the required dependencies, then navigate to just inside the cot-4500-as2 folder, and run the following in the terminal:
```
python src\main\assignment_2.py
```
This should automatically run the program.
